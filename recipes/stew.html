        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound (450g) of stew meat (beef, chicken, or lamb), cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 carrots, peeled and sliced</li>
            <li>3 potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
            <li>2 celery stalks, chopped</li>
            <li>4 cups (946ml) beef or vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 cup (237ml) red wine (optional)</li>
            <li>1 can (14.5 ounces or 411g) diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup (237ml) frozen peas</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onions and minced garlic. Saut√© for a few minutes until they become fragrant and translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the stew meat to the pot. Brown the meat on all sides, stirring occasionally. This should take about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in the red wine (if using) and scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Let it simmer for a few minutes until the wine reduces slightly.</li>
            <li>Add the diced tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, and celery to the pot. Stir everything together.</li>
            <li>Pour in the beef or vegetable broth, ensuring that the ingredients are mostly covered by the liquid. If needed, you can add more broth or water.</li>
            <li>Toss in the bay leaves and dried thyme. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let the stew simmer for at least 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the meat and vegetables are tender.</li>
            <li>About 10 minutes before serving, add the frozen peas to the stew. Cook until they are heated through.</li>
            <li>Taste the stew and adjust the seasoning if necessary.</li>
            <li>Remove the bay leaves before serving.</li>
            <li>Ladle the hot stew into bowls and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        </ul>
