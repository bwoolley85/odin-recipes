        <h2>Golden-brown flatbread on a wooden cutting board</h2>
        <p>Viking flatbread, a mainstay in Norse cuisine, is a straightforward and robust creation. Composed of whole wheat and barley flours, this unleavened bread is a testament to Viking resourcefulness. Cooked on griddles, it served as a versatile accompaniment to their meals, often enjoyed with smoked fish or honey. Its slightly sweet, nutty flavor and rustic texture make it a simple yet hearty delight that transports us back to the culinary traditions of the Viking age.</p>
